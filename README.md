1. For details refer to paper: 
Aniket Roy, Arpan Kumar Maiti, Kuntal Ghosh. "An HVS Inspired Robust Non-blind Watermarking Scheme in YCbCr Color Space"
International Journal of Image and Graphics, Jul 2018.

2. Two schemes are: Additive and Multiplicative.

3. Additive: main file: dwt_svd_min_additive_ycucv.m

4. Post processing file: e.g., ycucv_min_additive_compression.m for compression post processing.

5. Post processing file for multiplicative scheme: e.g., lab_mean_multiplicative_compression.m for compression.
